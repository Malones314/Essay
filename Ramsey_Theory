//In discrete mathematics, Ramsey's theorem states that for any positiveinteger k, there is an integer m such that in any party with at least m guests,
//one of thefollowing statements must be true:
//(1)There are at least k guests who know each other.
//(2) There are at least k guests who do not know eachother.
//For example,fork = 3, then in any party of at least 6 guests, either there are threeguests who know each other, or there are three guests who do
//not know each other.This question asks you to write a program to helpverify Ramsey's theorem. The input of the program is organized as follows:
//The first line of the input has an integer m, followed by m lines of string, eachrepresenting a guest (so there are totally m guests for this input).
//Then, there is another line of integer n, followed by n lines of pair of guests (guesta and guest b know each other if and only if there is a line of
//pair a, b in the input
//Then, there is a line containing an integer k.
//For the output,your program should print a set of k guests who knows each other, and ifthere is no 'such set, the program should print a set of k guests
//who do not know eachother.
